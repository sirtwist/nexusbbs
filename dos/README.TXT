Nexus Bulletin Board System
Open Source Project
08/31/2002


This document will be relatively brief because this is the first release of
the source code.

At this time, I have just lumped all the code in one zip archive called
source.zip.  There is no documentation and the code is sort of a mess.  It
SHOULD, however, all compile.

I will be publishing more information regarding the project in the near
future.  Stay tuned to http://www.nexusbbs.net for further developments.

If you have any questions, please email me at groberts@nexusbbs.net.
